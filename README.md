# Student Performance Analysis at City University Malaysia

## Executive Summary
City University Malaysia faces challenges in efficiently tracking student performance, evaluating course outcomes, and optimizing resources.  
This project proposes a **Business Intelligence (BI) solution** using Python for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization to improve student success rates and resource management.

## Problem Statement
Although student data is available, there is no integrated data-driven system to track academic performance, assess course effectiveness, or optimize resources.  
This gap reduces the chances of timely interventions and limits curriculum improvements.

## Dataset Source
- Dataset: [Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)  
- Contains demographic info, parental background, test preparation, and exam scores.  

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing (Python, Pandas)**  
   - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize column names  
   - Feature engineering: compute average score, assign Pass/Fail  

2. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   - Resource utilization  
   - Access patterns  
   - Correlation of study behavior with performance  

3. **Predictive Analysis**  
   - ML models to predict failure risk  
   - Personalized recommendations  
   - Resource scalability forecasting  

4. **Visualization (Power BI)**  
   - Dashboards on overall performance, subject weaknesses, prep test impact, parental influence, gender comparison  

## Results
- Average student score: **67.77**  
- Pass rate: **89.7%**  
- Weakest subject: **Mathematics**  
- Test preparation courses significantly boost scores  
- Parental education positively correlates with performance  

## BI Dashboard Functioning
- **Interactive filters** for gender, parental education, test prep, etc.  
- **KPIs**: pass rate, average scores, at-risk students  
- **Visuals**: bar charts, line graphs, heat maps  
- Helps lecturers and admins identify weak students early and allocate resources effectively
